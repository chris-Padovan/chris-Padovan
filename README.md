Projects
üëï Project Atelier:
React | ContextAPI | Styled Components | React Router | JEST | Webpack

Built a front end React based website for an ecommerce client. Using Webpack, React, and styled-components, I personally built the Questions and Answers component, which includes showing all relevant questions for a product, the answers for each question, as well as ratings for each of the above. Also includes a search bar function to search for specific terms or questions.

üî• Rumble:
Next.js | React | Tailwind CSS | Firebase | Express.js | Cloud Firestore

Tasked with building Tinder but for restaurants by a client. I personally acted as product manager, and built the homepage, top restaurants page, and built framework to route all components together.

üèî Mtn Dew:
Node.js | PostgreSQL | Express.js | Amazon EC2 | NGINX | K6 | Jest | loader.io

Follow up to Atelier. After updating their website, tasked with rebuilding their API to handle increased loads. Deployed across Amazon EC2 instances, and load balanced with NGINX to use a Postgres database.

üê∏ Slippi Visualizer:
Node.js | React | Express.js | Slippi

Developed a front end interface to visually represent data from Super Smash Bros Melee emulation metadata files. Using the Slippi Js library, I was able to read data from matches, and output it to a Reactjs application.
